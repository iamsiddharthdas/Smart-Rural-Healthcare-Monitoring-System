# Smart Rural Healthcare Monitoring System

In our project we are developing a healthcare technology through a medical chatbot irrelative of the traditional healthcare system and itâ€™s Beneficial using a cloud systems which helps in sending the requests from the patients to the cloud which helps in a faster diagnosis of the diseases. Firstly, we are processing the data using a high performance computing system which is parallel processing and hence helps in giving three result in an efficient and faster way.Basically, interfacing HPC and parallel processing helps in providing the results or output faster.An additional feature in this project is the iris scanner which diagonisis chronic diseases in a smarter way with the help of DSLR,a macro lense and using an indirect bio lense. And in addition to this we have also incorporated a complete medical datasets into the HPC which further adds to the easy diagonisis of any major diseases or any sort of medical issues. And we are using various sensors for a basic healthcare monitoring like heartbeat, blood pressure, pulse and temperature. Overall, our project involves in out ruling the traditional healthcare system by introducing a technological and a versatile rural healthcare management system using HPC for its efficiency and other resources .
